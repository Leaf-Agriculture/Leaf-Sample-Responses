Here you can find an example response from Leaf's Satellite API.

Inside folder "images_returned" you can see all the images we return for a Field.

The ones starting with a capital "B" are the individual satellite bands, so you can calculate whatever index you want.

At the same time we provide raw NDVI so you can apply your color-ramp or you can use ours.

Example Field image (RGB PNG) and colored NDVI (PNG):
